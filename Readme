Login Instructions:

To login for the first time, invoke the "connect" action of the node "twitter" with any username.
This will create an "Authentication URL" node. Go to the url specified by that node's value, and
authorize the app to use your twitter account. This will give you an authentication pin.
 Invoke the "Authorize" action with this pin, and you're done. The "twitter" node should now have
 several useful actions you can invoke.
 
 On subsequent logins, just invoke the "connect" action with the same username you used previously.
